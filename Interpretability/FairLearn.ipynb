        "Fairlearn is an open-source, Python package that aims to help data scientists improve fairness in machine learning models. It provides algorithms and tools to assess and mitigate unfairness in models. While Fairlearn does not offer a specific \"Fairlearn Logistic Regression Classifier\" out of the box, you can use Fairlearn's tools alongside scikit-learn's LogisticRegression to assess and mitigate bias.\n",

        "- Load a dataset and split it into features and target.\n",
        "- Train a standard logistic regression model.\n",
        "- Use Fairlearn's MetricFrame to assess fairness-related metrics on the model's predictions.\n",
        "- Apply a mitigation technique from Fairlearn to reduce bias."
