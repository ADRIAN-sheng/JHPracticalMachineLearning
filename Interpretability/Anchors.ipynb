        "- Model Training: A RandomForestClassifier is trained on the breast cancer dataset.\n",
        "- AnchorTabular Explainer: The AnchorTabular explainer is initialized with the model's prediction function and the feature names from the dataset. It's then fit on the training data, where disc_perc specifies the percentile used for discretizing numeric features into intervals.\n",
        "- Generating Explanations: For each of the first three instances in the test set, we generate an explanation that consists of an \"anchor\" (a rule that sufficiently guarantees the prediction), along with its precision (the proportion of instances where the anchor applies and the prediction remains the same) and coverage (the proportion of all instances where the anchor applies).\n",
        "\n",
        "Output Interpretation:\n",
        "- Anchor: The explanation rules that, when satisfied, lead to the same prediction with high confidence.\n",
        "- Precision: Confidence in the anchor's prediction when its conditions are met.\n",
        "- Coverage: The proportion of dataset instances for which the anchor's conditions hold.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach offers an intuitive way to understand the decision-making process of complex models by providing human-understandable rules that lead to specific predictions."
